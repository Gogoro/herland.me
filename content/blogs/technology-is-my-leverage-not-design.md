I know I'm not the only nerd in the world that struggles with design.

In the product development cycle I feel on fire when programming.
Good music, good progress, good vibes.

Then... the part that I always dread appears. The design and marketing part.

Figuring out what colors my product should have, the logo, the catching marketing
copy. My productivity derails immediately.

Today, after a good chat with my girlfriend I started to see this in a different light.

1. I'm building very technical products
2. My main clients are result-oriented businesses
3. They want the solution, not a fancy packaging

Why am I overthinking this?

The client is not going to care that I use Tailwind Plus components to build my
marketing website. They are not going to care if my site is blue or green.

All they care about is the solution, and not getting an ick of my design.

Therefore I hereby declare that my mind must change.

No more overthinking about design.

Just do. Just ship it.
