Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how momentum can be used as leverage.
More specifically how it can be used in my own life as leverage.

For a long time I've felt stuck — trapped in this bubble where I kept searching
for something or someway to get me to where I want to be. Like there is something
missing. I've consumed many books, articles, videos and podcasts, yes. But I've
also built multiple businesses both successfull and unsuccessful.

So it's not like I haven't moved. Or haven't done anything right. But I've still
felt like I'm just swimming around in the first level of life. Like I can't break
through that glass ceiling - to where I want to go.

I've been doing a lot of soul searching and thinking. I finally think I've found
one of the gems that is needed in order to get to where I want to go. Momentum.
Raw momentum.

Stop overthinking. Stop overengineering. Stop perfecting. Stop making everything
scalable. Stop procrastinating. Stop listening to motivation. Stop with writing
down every plan and every strategy.

Start building first versions. Start marketing. Start writing. Start releasing.
Do it, do it fast, and don't look back.

This momentum has given me the ability to get shit done. In volumes.

Long story short. I started over again with a clean slate in 2024-08. I built
up a consulting portfolio so I have a stable income for me and my family, and
now I've released my first [product](https://quick3-for-woocommerce.no/en/).
With the entire loop. Product, marketing, sales, partnerships, Ads, funnel, etc.
One full loop.

Today I created this website. On one day. With everything. Products, this post,
about me page, rss feed, hosting, etc. While doing this, my product chugged along.

Making money and running ads - in the background. Humming along.

This is what I'm talking about. The momentum. Now I've finally started to build
up "legacy" that I can have to stand on while I do the next thing.

It's like walking up the stairs to get up, instead of just walking around the
house over and over again. Finally. Finally I feel like I'm going up the right
set of stairs, to my apartment.
