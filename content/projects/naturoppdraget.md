**Partner project done with Veniro Media Solutions AS.**

[Naturoppdraget](https://naturoppdraget.no/nb) is a platform made for the Visiting Centers in Norway. They are responsible for educating people about the local environment and animals that live there.

**The new [Naturoppdraget](https://naturoppdraget.no/nb) platform had over 1 800 people signed in within a few months, and well over 20 000 children registered to participate!**

We also implemented Google Cloud Vision AI to determine if images contained faces of children. Those where automatically marked in the system for admins to handle.

This platform hit me on a personal level because it is geared towards kindergartens, and getting more kids out in nature to learn and do assignments. I have two children myself, and they will hopefully also get to do these assignments.

When you look at the website ([https://naturoppdraget.no](https://naturoppdraget.no)), it might look like just a plain website, but it's actually a lot more to it.

The site is built up with one plain website, and two web applications.

- [Naturoppdraget.no](http://Naturoppdraget.no) - is the marketing website where everyone can see what it's all about, and check out the assignments.
- [minside.naturoppdraget.no](http://minside.naturoppdraget.no) - is the web app created for the kindergartens, and they can sign in here to complete tasks and track them.
- [admin.naturoppdraget.no](http://admin.naturoppdraget.no) - is the web app created for all the visiting centers and super admins. Here you can create new assignments, track submitted assignments and in general administer the whole solution.
