Medbuddy is a comprehensive logistics system I'm building for the medical industry, designed to give healthcare organizations complete control over their consumer equipment. The platform streamlines equipment tracking, management, and logistics workflows that are critical in medical environments.

Built with a modern tech stack featuring Expo for the mobile experience and a robust Golang API backend, Medbuddy is engineered for reliability and performance in demanding healthcare settings.

The platform is currently in development and will be launching soon.
