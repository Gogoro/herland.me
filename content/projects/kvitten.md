## What is Kvitten?

It's simple and neat! The amount of waste generated from printed store receipts is staggering. While skipping receipts is one solution, it's not idealâ€”especially for business expenses.

Here is where Kvitten comes in. Kvitten is a system that integrates with Point of Sale registers and automatically generates digital invoices. Customers can claim their invoice by simply tapping an NFC tag at the register.

This eliminates the need for paper receipts and has the potential for significant environmental impact.

## My role

As a consultant for Veniro Media Solutions, I built the system from scratch.

I handled everything from PoS system integrations to coding the secure NFC tags. When a customer taps the NFC tag, it generates a new encrypted URL, ensuring their receipt remains private and secure.

To ensure low cost in the beginning, while having the scalability ready I used a simple yet effective tech stack.
