**While being a partner in Levelup we created a tool for Talkmore [Large Norwegian Telecom company]. They needed an app for their sales team out in the field, talking to people and converting them to paying customers on tablets.**

**We created a custom React application with NodeJS as the backend, and integrated the tool with multiple external sources. After the sales where complete, they got loaded into their core systems automatically. Everything worked really smoothly, and they converted a huge number of people through the platform ðŸ“ˆðŸ¤©**
