I wrote an integration between WooCommerce and PCK with Veniro.

The integration is written as a free standing service between the two platforms, so the same code and server can be used for multiple installations. This takes away a lot of load from the WordPress installation, and makes it possible for Veniro to control access to the integration.

The integration is written in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en), with [Google cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run?hl=en) and [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql?hl=en) for the infrastructure. It's lean, clean and mean.

If you are interested in using it for your own business, reach out to me or Veniro, and we'll help you get started.
