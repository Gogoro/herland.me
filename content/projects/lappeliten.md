In January 2025, I began working with Lappeliten, a mid-sized Norwegian
company specializing in personalized name labels and children's accessories.
With revenues around 100MNOK, they had built a successful business but were
facing two main challenges. They needed redundancy - a.k.a. another developer
and to make the tech stack solid and scaleable.

My role for this client spans the full technicalspectrumâ€”frontend, backend,
infrastructure, data engineering, and strategic planning.

## The Landscape

Walking into Lappeliten's tech environment, I found a diverse stack that
reflected years of finding solutions while handling quick growth:

- **Frontend**: Next.js application serving customers
- **Backend**: Multiple Java applications handling business logic
- **Database**: HSQL managing operational data
- **Data layer**: Minimal analytics infrastructure

I started getting familiar witht the stack and solving problems that had been
breewing for years. We are working on improving scalability, workflow and adopting
to more scalable technolgies to carry the copany to the next level.

I can't say to much, but I love working with Lappeliten. There is many forward
leaning projects that gets done, and the hunger for improvements are there.

A really fun place to be, and a really good client to work for <3
