description: This design tells a fun story of the time that we tried to do cold calling to generate leads in Levelup. We got a meeting with Skagerak Energi, and we presented an alternative to how the entire website could look. They very politely said that they liked the design, but they were "stuck" with their current vendor. I'm pretty happy with how the design turned out tho.
