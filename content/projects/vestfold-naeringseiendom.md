**In 2019 after years of grinding it out, my business partner and I invested in Real Estate. We found some 💎, did some alterations and sold for profit. It was really exiting to work on something completely "offline" 🤓**

Being lazor focused on the digital space for so long, it was refreshing to start the Vestfold Næringseiendom journey. This thought me a lot about how "the real world" works.

My role in the business was being the chairman and CFO. I was heavily involved in deciding which properties we where going to invest in, based on thorough analysis of numbers and the market. I also did all the accounting for this business and our other businesses for many years, so that we could both save money and get deeper insights into the core of the business.

Working in Vestfold Næringseiendom I've learned so much about investments, banking, corporate law, strategies while making good profits at the same time. I even became 10% more of a handy man, which was a lot of fun! 🪚

After a lot of soul searching and thinking, I've decided that Real Estate is not the game I want to play in the long run. There is a lot of money to be made in the market, and the work is fine. But my true passion is and will always be for tech.

We have decided to sell all our properties, and scale the business down to zero. It was one hell of a journey, but now accounting books are going to be completely switched with tech and science books 🤓❤️
