RÃ¸island & Co is a realtor located in the capitol of Norway, Oslo. They are one of (if not the) best real estate agencies in Norway. Their main focus is on doing projects where they sell all the apartments in brand new apartment buildings.

In Levelup we designed and built a new website from scratch with Craft CMS, NodeJS and ReactJS. I'm proud of the work we did, and it was a lot of fun ðŸ”¥

Throughout the relationship we where also collaborating on a lot of real estate projects they where selling. I think these where the coolest and best real estate projects in Norway to be honest, and it was an honour to be part of it. ðŸ«¡
