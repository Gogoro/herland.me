I just finished my internship and got invited to pitch for the Linstow project. I worked really hard making a clean, professional and expressive design. Seeing their happy faces and hearing that we won still gives me butterflies. That was my first big win and it felt AMAZING ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• We developed the site within budget and celebrated afterwards. Good times!
