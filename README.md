## Vibe Engeneered

I've gotten really into using coding agents like Claude Code to increase my
productivity while still having my hand on the steeringwheel. Vibe coding is
a term that is used by people that don't know how to code, and just get agents
to sprew out whole apps. This is something I'm trying to take great distance from
by using this new word that has started to emerge. Vibe Engeneering. Where you
take a skilled programmer, and give it AI to work faster - While still knowing
the ins-and-outs of all parts of the code.

This website. My personal website is Vibe Engeneered. But all content is hand
written. a.k.a. Flaws included.

I don't want to loose my tone of voice of pesonality.

## Content

For now, the website is very plain and simple.

This is intentional, since I don't want to split my time or focus to much.

Therefore I will be sharing my thoughts in journals on [https://iniva.no](https://iniva.no).
This is my very own buisness, where I do consultant work and create products.

## Tech stack

I'm using astro as the engine.
The page is hosted with ploi.io. My current favourite for just hosting a lot of
small and simple projects. Simple, cheap and scales well enough for where I am
on my journey.

It's very fast, simple and easy to maintain.
