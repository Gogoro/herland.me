## Tech Stack
I wanted to combine two thoughts that has been running in the community for a while. 

1. The No Build movement where you don't need to compile everything. Just keeping plain CSS and JavaScript.
2. The movement to simpler tools, like HTMX + Go. Fewer abstractions, less frameworks and libraries.

At first, I was sceptical, but I must say I love the feeling of keeping it light. It's a dream to work with, and it feels rock solid.

- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)
