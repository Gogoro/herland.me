  <p>
    I'm a builder and L.O.V.E technology.
  </p>

  <h2>Technology, my passion</h2>
  <p>
    My passion for technology is a lot broader than most professionals. I love working across disciplines and it makes me a really good all-rounder.
  </p>
  <p>
    My main focus has always been applications connected to the world wide web. Making websites, web- and mobile applications, integrations, APIs, CI/CD flow and working with infrastructure.
  </p>

  <h2>Entrepreneurial spirit</h2>
  <p>
    I have an entrepreneurial background that gives me an edge when working as a consultant. I've built and sold two successful businesses, and failed on a couple more. This has given me a lot of insights into what works, and what doesn't.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's all about the journey, and I love it.
